# Lights Out

Based on the electronic game *Lights Out* from the '90s.

(Please forgive the styling)

## Description

When the game begins, a random stored pattern of "lights" on the board will light up. Clicking any of the lights, whether on or off, will toggle the lights surrounding it (top, bottom, left and right). The point of the game is to turn off all the lights in as few moves as possible.
